# ATM-Banking-System-Project-Assembly-Language
This project is a simple banking system implemented in x86 assembly language for the emu8086 emulator.
It allows users to log in or sign up, and perform basic banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing funds, transferring money, and checking account balances.
The system features a menu-driven interface, basic user authentication, and simple error handling.
Designed primarily as an educational tool, it helps learners understand low-level programming concepts, user input/output, and control flow in assembly language.
While functional for demonstration purposes, it is not intended for real-world banking use due to limited security, scalability, and features.
